## Current Capabilities

The system can now:
1. Read data from CSV files
2. Filter records based on conditions
3. Rename and map fields
4. Write processed data to CSV
5. Track progress and statistics
6. Run in Docker containers
7. Support multiple deployment modes

**Working Example:**
```
CSV → Filter (age > 18) → Mapping (rename fields) → CSV
```
