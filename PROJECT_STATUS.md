---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Web UI** - Command-line and configuration files only
2. **Limited Plugins** - Only CSV input/output available
3. **No Job Management** - Cannot create/manage jobs via API
4. **No Scheduling** - Manual execution only
5. **Single Mode** - Standalone mode only (no distributed)
6. **No Checkpointing** - Cannot resume from failures
7. **Basic Error Handling** - Limited retry logic

### Technical Debt

- Old plugin files (`plugin/`, `source/`, `sink/`, `processor/`) need cleanup
- Main.go in root should be removed (duplicate of cmd/fustgo/main.go)
- Test coverage needs improvement (currently ~20% overall)
- Integration tests not implemented
- API documentation not generated

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Plugin complexity growth | Medium | Medium | Clear plugin development guide, templates |
| Performance bottlenecks | High | Low | Benchmarking, profiling planned |
| Third-party API changes | Low | Low | Version pinning, compatibility tests |
| Database migration issues | Medium | Low | Schema versioning, migration scripts |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Dependency scanning, security audits |

---

## Conclusion

**FustGo DataX has achieved a solid 50% implementation** with all core components in place and working. The system can successfully perform CSV-to-CSV data transfers with filtering and mapping, which validates the core architecture.

### Project Health: ✅ **HEALTHY**

- ✅ Clear architecture
- ✅ Working code
- ✅ Passing tests
- ✅ Good documentation
- ✅ Docker deployment ready
- ✅ Foundation for growth

### Readiness Assessment

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Development | ✅ Ready | Can add new features |
| Testing | ⚠️ Partial | Need more tests |
| Deployment | ✅ Ready | Docker works |
| Production | ❌ Not Ready | Need API, UI, more plugins |
| Open Source | ✅ Ready | Good docs, contributing guide |

### Recommendation

**Continue development** following the priority roadmap. The foundation is strong enough to support rapid feature addition. Focus on:

1. Increasing test coverage to 60%+
2. Implementing Job Manager
3. Adding database plugins (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
4. Building REST API

With these additions, the system will reach 70-75% completion and be ready for beta testing.
